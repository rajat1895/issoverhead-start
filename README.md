# issoverhead-start

This script checks if the International Space Station (ISS) is overhead and if it's currently night time at the user's location using two APIs.
If both conditions are met, it sends an email notification to the user informing them that the ISS is above them in the sky. 
The script uses the smtplib library to send emails and the requests library to make HTTP requests to the APIs.
